# Python Version Features

This project aim to summarize all new features of python from 3.5 to the future.

- For a new syntax, it should give a concrete and concise code demonstration.
- If a feature is difficult to describe by code snippet, It should be explained in concise text.

## Keep it Evergreen

The unique golden information sources are:

- [What's new in python](https://docs.python.org/zh-cn/3/whatsnew/index.html)
- the official PEP announcements

In order to reduce the burden of manpower and stay focused, it uses [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) as a
proofreading programming consultant. Because the ChatGPT makes mistakes frequently, PEPs should be used for prescriptive
bootstrapping.

The update policy is currently manually updated.
